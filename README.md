ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is an Intelligent Reasoning Assistant, initially scaffolded with Crew AI but heavily customized and developed by me. While Crew AI provided the initial structure, I wrote most of the functionality by hand â€” updating the codebase, fixing issues, and restructuring the project so it works as a clean, self-contained AI agent.

The assistant is designed to:

Perform step-by-step reasoning to solve problems logically.

Engage in natural conversations with users.

Use a modular, extensible design that makes it easy to add tools and new features.

Run locally in VS Code without depending on Crew AI internals.

I focused on making this project feel hand-built and professional, with well-structured Python code, clear configuration files, and easy integration into GitHub. The result is a project that demonstrates not only AI capabilities, but also my skills in software engineering, agent design, and clean code practices.
